# Pretty Graph Algorithms
_Graph go brrrr_

---

## About

A small project to give nice visual representations of several popular/efficient algorithms on graphs. I enjoy looking at it just as much as I do. (Also, it was nice to brush up on my TypeScript, npm, webpack, etc. skills ^^).

## Demo

You should be able to find a live-demo [here](https://mattmoony.github.io/pretty-graph-algorithms).
